# client
Pixelbox server implementation.  
Uses `/ext` thirdparty libraries and some `/shared` code.  
Has some GUI, but they are optional, minimal docs (for configs).  
But can't render world by itself, can only process it and communicate with clients, establilsh connection, auth clients and so on...
