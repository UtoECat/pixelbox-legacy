# client
Pixelbox client implementation.  
Uses `/ext` thirdparty libraries and some `/shared` code.  
Has a lot of GUI, docs, icons and other cool stuff.  
But can't process world by itself, can only render it and communicate with
server to get actual world pieces, to apply user input to the world.
